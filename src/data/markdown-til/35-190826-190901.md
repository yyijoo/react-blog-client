- Side Effect of react and redux and handling method.
    - Basically react and redux aims at functional programming which expects consistent output based on input. But asynchronous things like data fetching and impure things like accessing the browser cache hinder consistent output.

- HTTP Long Polling
    - HTTP transactions should be initiated by the web client. HTTP Long polling is developed to overcome this deficiency. The server holds the request open until new data is available. Once available, the server responds and sends the new information to the client. When the client receives the new information, it immediately sends another request, and the operation is repeated. By doing it, it emulates a server push feature.

- The reason for the creation of ES6 Generator
    - Once the function starts running, it can not be interrupted now that javascript is single-threaded. (only one command/function executing at any given time.) With ES6 Generator, however, the function may be paused in the middle and resumed later.
