- list, char, tobyte in python
  - Basic Data type
    - Numeric
      - Integers
      - floats
      - complex
    - Boolean : bool
    - Text : str
  - Container Data type
    - Sequence Types
      - list : It's just like arrays in other languages. mutable sequence data type. ex) a = ["apple", "banana", "orange"]
      - tuple : immutable sequence data type. ex) a = ("apple", "banana", "orange")
        - difference between list and tuple : [https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-difference-between-list-and-tuple/](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-difference-between-list-and-tuple/)

- bitmap
  - ref: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitmap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitmap)
  - a bitmap is a mapping from some domain to bits. (ex. a range of integers).
  - It also refer to a particular bitmapping application: the pix-map, which refers to a map of pixels, where each one may store more than two colors, thus using more than one bit per pixel.
- konva
  - an HTML5 JavaScript Canvas framework that extends 2d context by enabling canvas interactivity.
  - It's based on KineticJS which is no more maintained.
  - <Stage> = div / <Layer> = canvas
- UML (= Unified Modeling Language)
  - ref: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Modeling_Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Modeling_Language)
  - Its purpose is to provide a standard way to visualize the design of a system.
  - It offers a way to visualize a system's architectural blueprints in a diagram, including element such as:
    - any activity (major task that must take place to fulfill an operation contract.)
    - individual components of the system
      - and how they can interact with other software components
    - how the system will run
    - how entities interact with others. ( components and interfaces)
    - external user interface
  - Good material to understand the overall structure of UML : [http://www.nextree.co.kr/p6753/](http://www.nextree.co.kr/p6753/)

- How to get exact width and height size of image : Make image element with given file URL and get the size of it.
  - [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8903854/check-image-width-and-height-before-upload-with-javascript](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8903854/check-image-width-and-height-before-upload-with-javascript)
  - Given file URL can be obtained using URL.createObjectURL()
    - It creates a DOM String containing a URL representing the object given in the parameter. The new object URL represents the specified File object or Blob object.
- Typed array (= array-like object)
  - It is for reading and writing raw binary data in memory buffers. A Typed Array is a slab of memory with a typed view into it. With typed array, the JavaScript engine can access to the data without converting the data to a native representation. So it's faster.
  - Typed Arrays split the implementation into buffer and views.
    - buffer : It is an object representing a chunk of data. (implemented by the ArrayBuffer object)
    - view : In order to access the memory contained in a buffer, you need to use a view. A view provide a context that turns the data into a typed array.
      - I can't get what exactly context is. It comes to as something used to convert raw binary data into more usable form of data.

- Raster
  - information of pixels
- ArrayBuffer
  - array of bytes
  - It is impossible to directly manipulate the content of the ArrayBuffer.

- Uint8ClampedArray
  - It's typed array. It represents an array of 8-bit unsigned integers clamped to 0-255.
- Unsigned Integers
  - ref: [https://www.cs.utah.edu/~germain/PPS/Topics/unsigned_integer.html](https://www.cs.utah.edu/~germain/PPS/Topics/unsigned_integer.html)
  - Unsigned Integers are just like integers but don't have a + or - sign associated with them. Thus they are always non-negative.
  - The advantage to using the unsigned version is that the computer will spot errors for you.
