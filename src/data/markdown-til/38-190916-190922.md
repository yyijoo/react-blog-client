- ReactDOMServer
    - This object enables you to generate static markup.
    - I'm trying to extract react component as html. I should convert React component into HTML file and make it downloadable. I tried using its renderToString() method for it. In React's official doc, element should be passed in to it as parameter. So I used refs's current, but it didn't work out well. The error I got : Objects are not valid as a React child (found: [object HTMLDivElement]). If you meant to render a collection of children, use an array instead.

- Generate and Download file from JS
    - ref: [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45831191/generate-and-download-file-from-js](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45831191/generate-and-download-file-from-js)
- encodeURIComponent()
    - what it does : The function encodes special characters like , / ? : @ & = + $ #
    - why it's needed: Some characters present the possibility of being misunderstood within URLs for various reason. So Theses characters should also always be encoded.
- Binary-to-text encoding
    - It is encoding of data in plain text. More precisely, it is an encoding of binary data in a sequence of printable characters. These encodings are necessary for transmission of data when the channel does not allow binary data. (such as email) or is not 8-bit clean
        - What does 8-bit clean mean? For example, ASCII only uses 7 bits, if a channel is designed to transport only ASCII-encoded data, it is free to use the high-order bit of each 8-bit byte for other purposes. Such a channel will not be able to properly transfort data in which all 8 bits in each byte are significant.

- HTTP
    - URI : Uniform Resource Identifier
        - URL : Uniform Resource Locater, a kind of URI. The identity and location of resources on the web are mostly given by a single URL.
    - Data URLs : URLs prefixed with data: scheme. It allows content creators to embed small files inline in documents.

- How to open a new window with HTML I write: 

        const content = this.reportRef.current.innerHTML;
        const win = window.open();
        win.document.write(content)
        win.document.title = "Preview Report"
        win.document.close();
    - document.open() can be omitted. But close() should be called imperatively.
    - window.open(url, windowName, [windowFeature])
        - It loads the specified resource into the browsing context with the specified name.
- DOMString
    - It is used to ensure interoperability. Some might not implement string as UTF-16 sequences by default. So they can implement a separate type to map to DOMString if necessary.

- Generate and Download html file.
    - I implemented it with Vanilla Javascript using <a> element's 'download' attribute. But it doesn't support IE. so I had to use fileSaver.js library instead.

        vanilla javascript code
        onClickExportHTML = () => {
        const content = this.reportRef.current.innerHTML;
        const element = document.createElement('a')
        element.setAttribute('href', 'data:text/plain;charset=utf-8,' + encodeURIComponent(content));
        element.setAttribute('download', "Test.html");
        element.style.display = 'none';
        document.body.appendChild(element);
        element.click();
        document.body.removeChild(element);
        }

- Problem I faced: HTML to be downloaded includes images. It means that html file and images should be downloaded together and both shoud be located in designated directory so that html can import images. I wanted to create file or make user to select directory to download for it. But it's impossible to do it on client side using Javascript.
    - Solution: Creating zip file and Downloading it.
