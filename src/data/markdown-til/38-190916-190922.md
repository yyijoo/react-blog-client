- ReactDOMServer
    - This object enables you to generate static markup.
    - I'm trying to extract react component as html. I should convert React component into HTML file and make it downloadable. I tried using its renderToString() method for it. In React's official doc, element should be passed in to it as parameter. So I used refs's current, but it didn't work out well. The error I got : Objects are not valid as a React child (found: [object HTMLDivElement]). If you meant to render a collection of children, use an array instead.
