- ReactDOMServer
    - This object enables you to generate static markup.
    - I'm trying to extract react component as html. I should convert React component into HTML file and make it downloadable. I tried using its renderToString() method for it. In React's official doc, element should be passed in to it as parameter. So I used refs's current, but it didn't work out well. The error I got : Objects are not valid as a React child (found: [object HTMLDivElement]). If you meant to render a collection of children, use an array instead.

- encodeURIComponent()
    - what it does : The function encodes special characters like , / ? : @ & = + $ #
    - why it's needed: Some characters present the possibility of being misunderstood within URLs for various reason. So Theses characters should also always be encoded.
- Binary-to-text encoding
    - It is encoding of data in plain text. More precisely, it is an encoding of binary data in a sequence of printable characters. These encodings are necessary for transmission of data when the channel does not allow binary data. (such as email) or is not 8-bit clean
        - What does 8-bit clean mean? For example, ASCII only uses 7 bits, if a channel is designed to transport only ASCII-encoded data, it is free to use the high-order bit of each 8-bit byte for other purposes. Such a channel will not be able to properly transfort data in which all 8 bits in each byte are significant.
