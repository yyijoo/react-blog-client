- Factory Function
    - Factory Function is any function which is not a class or constructor return a object. Any function can return an object, but it does so without new keyword.
        - I remember I jotted down the patterns to make objects. But my memory is blurred... I need to look into it again.

- Iterator
    - It is an object that enables a programmer to traverse a container, particularly lists. Various types of iterators are often provided via a container's interface.
    - Javascript provides iteration interfaces such as for loops, map(), and filter().
    - Another way to traverse container is to use generator. Both Iterators and Generators allow us to build our own iterable objects. The difference is the explicit versus the implicit management of state.
- for ... in & for ... of
    - for ... in : It is a method for iterating over "enumerable" properties of an object.
    - for ... of : It is for iterating over "iterable collections".  There are objects that have a [Symbol.iterator] property.
- Situation I face : Need to get binary data of bunch of image from server. I sent GET request looping through array filled with each image's url at first. It didn't work out. It was because I iterated over an asynchronous data source. The result was empty. The iteration would complete before all values have been resolved. The Iterator is a sequential data operator.
    - The current Javascript Iterator and Generator only works for synchronous data sources.

    - Solution : Async callback

        - async function asyncForEach(array, callback) {
        for (let index = 0; index < array.length; index++) {
        await callback(array[index], index, array);
        }
        }
        - It saved my day.
- promise.all
This method takes as input a set of promises and returns a promise by itself, which resolved when all its input promises are resolved.
