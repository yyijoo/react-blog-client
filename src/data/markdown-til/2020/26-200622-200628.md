- Is the result different between dispatching action creator in generator function and dispatching it right away? I thought the former is synchronous and the latter is not. But It seems it's not. Need to dig into it.

    ```c
    // 1. Dispatching action creator in generator function.
    function* updateSelectedLabelSet(newLabelSet) {
        yield put(setSelectedLabelSet(newLabelSet));
    }

    yield* updateSelectedLabelSet(newLabelSetParam);

    // 2. Dispatching action creator right away.
    yield put(setSelectedLabelSet(newLabelSet));
    ```
