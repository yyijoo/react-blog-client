  - Compositing data every time component is rendered vs Retrieving data from store
    - When compositing simple table data filled with 10,000 rows, it took more times about 0.8 seconds. It's mere difference in this size.
    - Processing time gap is not the only thing to consider. Readability and Maintainability should be considered together. In my opinion, Even though it takes less time to render, If code readability or maintainability is poor, It can not be the best choice.
- Good article explaining a lot of good and practical tips I can't agree more. All of it is needed if you want to scale up your redux.

- ER Diagram (Entity Relationship Model)
  - [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entityâ€“relationship_model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity%E2%80%93relationship_model)
  - it's a kind of expression for structured data model. In software engineering, an ER model is commonly formed to represent things a business needs to remember in order to perform business processes. ER model becomes an abstract data model and it will be the base of a database.
- Using normaliz

  - The benefit of using normaliz in case you use loopback with backend - React - Redux - Redux-saga.
- redux-saga

  - Basic Concept (again)
    - take
    - effect: = action? Plain JavaScript Objects. An Effect is an obejct that contains some information to be interpreted by the middleware. It's like instructions to the middleware to perform some operation. Usally it gets a type constant and a function. If its type is passed, the function is fired.
    - call: = action creator? To call is to create effects
    - yield: any expression at the right of 'yield' is evaluated then the result is yielded to the caller.
    - difference between yielding without call or with call.
      - [https://redux-saga.js.org/docs/basics/DeclarativeEffects.html](https://redux-saga.js.org/docs/basics/DeclarativeEffects.html)
      - Declaring effect with call api is different from yielding without call in that we're not executing the fetch call immediately, instead, call creates a description of the effect.
        - Benefit 1: allows us to easily test the Generator outside the Redux environment.
        - Benefit 2: We can test all the logic inside a Saga. Complex asynchronous operations are no longer black boxes.
    - task: It seems one function is one unit of task.

  - Sequential Saga

- Factory Function
  - Any function returning object without new keyword is a factory function.
