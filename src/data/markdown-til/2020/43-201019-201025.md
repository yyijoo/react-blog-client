  - Babel vs Gulp: what's the difference?
    - [https://stackshare.io/stackups/babel-vs-gulp](https://stackshare.io/stackups/babel-vs-gulp)
    - Purpose of these: Process CSS + Javascript + Live reloading
    - Gulp: "Build speed", "Readable" and "Code-over-configuration" are the primary reason why gulp is favored.
    - Babel: "Modern Javascript works with all browsers", "Open source" and "Integration with lots of tools" are the key factors why developers consider Babel.
- For the first time, I looked into open source code. It's little bit a shame to do this now. I should have done it earlier.
  - JSDoc - I and my colleague often say it's not easy to keep tracking all the functions and to be on the ball. Documentation using something like JSDoc might help.
