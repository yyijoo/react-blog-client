- How to effectively store data structure and map all datas? 1) Make key depth 2) Always one depth. But Make another mapping data.
- Map vs Object
  - key : (Map) It can be any data type / (Object) It must be primitive types. (= undefined, boolean, number, string, bigint, symbol)
  - order : (Map) Original order of elements is preserved / (Object) It isn't
  - Inheritance : (Map) It's an instance of Object.
- How to create Object with property never changes.
  - Object.create(target [, propertiesObject])
    - Add objects filled with properties as second parameter when creating object.
