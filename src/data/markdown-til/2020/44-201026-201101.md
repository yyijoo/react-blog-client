- difference between `<thead>` and `<th>`
  - thead -> It defines a set of rows defining the head of the columns of the table
  - th -> It defines a cell as header of a group of table cells.
  - `<th>` is used to style a specific cell as a header cell rather than an ordinary data cell.
- Keys must only be unique among siblings.
  - They don't need to be globally unique. We can use the same keys when we produce two different arrays.
  - I only knew the fact "keys should be unique.", but didn't know the scope of its uniqueness. Vague knowledge is sometimes bad.
- React's Reconciliation
  - React uses diffing algorithm.
    - It first compares the two root elements.
      - 1. If the type of two root elements is different, it rebuilds the new tree from scratch.
      - 2. If the type of two root elements is same, it keeps same underlying DOM node, and only updates the changed attributes.
        - Then React recurses on the children.
          - When recursing, React iterates over two different children to compare at the same time and generates a mutation whenever there's a difference.
