- redux-saga
  - fork : It is used for execute generator saga function in asynchronous way. It starts a non-blocking task.
  - takeEvery : Every actions via takeEvaery are valid. It has same effect as adding 'while(true)' to saga function.
  - takeLatest : Only last action via takeLatest is valid.
- Iteration Protocols
  - It is new additions to ECMAScript2015.
  - Iteration Protocols = Iterable Protocol + Iterator Protocol
- Symbol
  - Why do we need Symbol?
    - It enables Objects to have unique property. Usually property name is string. But its names can be conflicted for same names.

- Generator
  - It is the opposite concept of Iterator. Iterator is reading interface and Generator is Writing interface.
  - It only returns Generator object when it's called.
  - When generator's next() method is called, it returns the value of the first yield.
  - Generator's yield
    - It is the keyword used to pause and resume a generator function.
    - On the right side of yield, the value to return from the generator function via the iterator protocol is defined.
    - On the left side, TBD

- redux-saga patterns
  - I want to organize our current sagas. We've been focusing on just using and utilizing it without caring much about using it well and properly.
  - Root Saga Pattern

    - The difference between one big all effect and several fork effects is...
      - all effect is blocking.
      - fork effects are non-blocking. You can get task descriptors. So you can cancel/join task via task descriptors in the subsequent code.

  - command line to create folder structure → tree / to create folder structure including files → tree /F
