- Used environment variable to handle different packages.
  - environment variable
    - An environment variable is a variable whose value is set outside the program, typically through functionality built into the operating system or microservice.
    - The primary use case for environment variables is to limit the need to modify and re-release an application due to changes in configuration data.
    - Management and manipulation of environment variable differ from OS to OS and varies across different microservices environments. So NPM package is used. I used cross-env.
