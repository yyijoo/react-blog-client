- Which is better? Class Component vs Function Component using hooks.
  - [https://overreacted.io/ko/how-are-function-components-different-from-classes/](https://overreacted.io/ko/how-are-function-components-different-from-classes/)
    - The performance differences are negligible.
      - Performance primarily depends on what the code is doing rather than whether you chose a function or a class.
      - Optimization strategies are different matter though.
    - The biggest difference is that function components capture the rendered values and class components use 'this'
      - There's less probability of bug with changed props in Functional Component.
      - Class components accept props using 'this'. Props are immutable, but this is, and has always been, mutable. React itself mutates it over time so that you can read the fresh version in the render and lifecycle methods.
    - In case you want to read the latest props or state that don't belong to the particular render, you can use 'ref'.
