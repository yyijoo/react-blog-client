  - Before ajax
    - Server makes HTML document and sends it to the client.
    - PHP is widely used.
    - Javascript is just the language used for splendid effect.
  - After ajax
    - With Ajax, web applications can send and retrieve data from a server asynchronously (in the background) without interfering with the display and behavior of the existing page.
    - Javascript starts to render view.
  - The rise of dynamic rendering → The rise of template engine.
    - template engine is...
      - template for view and data are separated.
      - template engine compile these two.
      - ex) hogan.js, mustach, handlebars
  - Increased complexity in web → The rise of framework
    - frameworks using MV\* pattern
      - ex) backbone.js
      - ex) AngularJS
    - frameworks/Library focused on view.
      - ex) React
  - Server-side-rendering using javascript to overcome cons of web app.

    - Again, server starts to render view.
    - But : Process of rendering view is more easy this time with the benefit of frameworks.
    - So : Cons of rendering view on client disappears.
    - oh yeah!

- The most basic concept of GraphQL

  - ref) [https://velopert.com/2318](https://velopert.com/2318)
  - You can actually 'query' to server. It's different from requesting to specific end point in that data to get is defined on client side. Through quering and fetching specific data, there's no overfetch nor underfetch.
