- Why Saga?

  - Why redux-saga?
    - Declarative effects: all operations in redux-saga yield plain Javascript objects, which makes it easier to test the business logic.
    - Advanced async control flow : simply describe async flow with sync style and familiar control flow constructs.
    - Concurrency management: provide primitives and operators to manage concurrency between tasks; able to *fork* multiple background tasks in parallel and cancel a running task.
    - Side effect handler: all side effects are moved into sagas, UI components do not perform any business logic but only dispatch actions to notify what happened.
