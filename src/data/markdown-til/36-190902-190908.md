- Parametric equation
    - It defines a group of quantities as functions of one or more independent variables called parameters. Parametric equations are commonly used to express the coordinates of the points that make up a geometric object such as a curve or surface.
        - independent variable : the variable that is changed or controlled in a scientific experiment - input ( the opposite is dependent variable : the variable that is being tested and measured - output)
- Bezier-curve
    - it is a parametric curve used in computer graphics and related field. Curve is within four control points so that it's intuitive to modify. The gist of bezier curve is to represent curve handily.
