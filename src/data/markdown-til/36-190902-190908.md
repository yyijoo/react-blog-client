- Using pseudo selector with material-ui
    - When using pseudo selector ':after' with property 'content', content value should be double quoted. ex) content:'""' instead of content: "". weird.

- Parametric equation
    - It defines a group of quantities as functions of one or more independent variables called parameters. Parametric equations are commonly used to express the coordinates of the points that make up a geometric object such as a curve or surface.
        - independent variable : the variable that is changed or controlled in a scientific experiment - input ( the opposite is dependent variable : the variable that is being tested and measured - output)
- Bezier-curve
    - it is a parametric curve used in computer graphics and related field. Curve is within four control points so that it's intuitive to modify. The gist of bezier curve is to represent curve handily.

- Data buffer
    - In computer science, a data buffer(or just buffer) is a region of a physical memory storage used to temporarily store data while it is being moved from one place to another. Typically, the data is stored in a buffer as it is retrieved from an input device or just before it is sent to an output device. However, a buffer may be used when moving data between processes within a computer.

- Redux dispatch
    - Dispatch is the only function that will trigger a change in the redux state. Every action in the action file must be wrapped in the dispatch function, which will then fire the action, alert the reducer of the action type, and trigger those updates.
    - action creator : the function that returns action.

- Circular buffers
    - A circular buffer, circular queue, cycle buffer or ring buffer is a data structure that uses a single, fixed-size buffer as if it were connected end-to-end.

    - circular buffer implemented in javascript : [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1583123/circular-buffer-in-javascript](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1583123/circular-buffer-in-javascript)
    - Data structure I wanted : fixed size, FIFO, new elements are added to the start and the rest of elements are sorted sequentially. But Circular buffer itself doesn't cover these in that it doesn't ensure new elements are added to the start.
